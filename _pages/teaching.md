# Teaching
### Visiting Instructor- <a href="https://ent.uom.lk/"> ENTC, University of Moratuwa</a>
I assist the lecturers in assignment preparation, evaluations, laboratory work, and invigilation of examinations.
Additionally I conduct reviews on problem sets, and conduct extra sessions when students request additional help or tutoring.
