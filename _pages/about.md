<div style="text-align: justify; width: 800px">
I'm a Post-Baccalaureate Research Fellow in the Center for Advanced Imaging at Harvard University, where I focus developing deep learning based tools for applications in microscopy, histopathology and protein structure modeling under supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LHmeoN4AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Dushan Wadduwage</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8KJ9gf4AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Sergey Ovchinnikov</a>. My interest lies in the fusion of deep learning and computer vision with medicine and biology for both problem solving and enabling new discoveries (mainly towards cancer and histopathology research). 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	I completed my bachelor's degree specializing in biomedical engineering at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.   My final year thesis project was on developing an "Interpretable Multi-Modal Sleep Monitoring System using Ear-EEG and EOG" under supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=q9fZXZMAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Anjula De Silva </a> and <a href= "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qe5byo4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Chamira Edussooriya</a>, along with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HTFY3fsAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Simon Lind Kappel</a> from Aarhus University. Previously, I worked as a remote visiting undergraduate research fellow in Center for Advanced Imaging at Harvard, under supervision of Dr. Dushan Wadduwage focusing on deep-learning based image reconstruction algorithms for microscopy. I did my remote research internship under supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=dgvZEqgAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Sam John</a> from University of Melbourne. Also, I got industrial exposure through research internship at Synergen Technology Labs (PVT) Ltd.
