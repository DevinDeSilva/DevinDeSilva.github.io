I am a final year biomedical undergraduate at University of Moratuwa. My interest lies in the fusion of deep learning and computer vision with medicine to solve health care related problems. Currently, I am working on my final year thesis on multi-modality based comfortable sleep monitoring system under supervision of Dr. Anjula De Silva and Dr. Chamira Edussooriya, along with Dr. Simon Lind Kappel from Aarhus University. I am also working as a remote visiting undergraduate research fellow at Center for Advanced Imaging in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, under supervision of Dr. Dushan Wadduwage focusing on deep-learning based image reconstruction algorithms for microscopy.  I did my research internship under supervision of Dr. Sam John, Senior Lecturer in Neural Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Melbourne. Also, I got industrial exposure through research internship at Synergen Technology Labs (PVT) Ltd.
