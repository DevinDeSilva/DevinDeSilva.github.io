I'm a ML Engineer at <a href="https://www.irononetech.com/ai-lab">IronOne Technologies, Austin Texas</a>. 
My current research interests lie in Explainable AI and Zero-shot Learning Domain and currently I am working on fintech domain and utilizing model explanations to provide valuable insights to a major asset management company. By exploiting my theoretical knowledge, I engaged in projects and work spanning aspects of research, including data analysis, formulating an optimization objective, and algorithm design.

	I completed my Bachelors in Engineering with First Class Honors with a First class at the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My final year thesis project was on <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rxf-hAJIIcGCCiIdIeypW6IJ_7LkIwQdmw8HNe7HueU/edit?usp=sharing">"Explainable Zero-Shot Learning for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition"</a>. This research aimed to introduce explainability to Zero-shot Human activity recognition by utilizing skeleton videos but generates the videos through a parameter-efficient method. Further, as self-initiated research projects, I have worked on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03873">(efficient text recognition methodology)</a>.
