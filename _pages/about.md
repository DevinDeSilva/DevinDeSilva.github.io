<div style="text-align: justify; width: 800px">
I'm a Visiting Instructor at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I work on computational imaging and deep learning-based image reconstruction research with <a href="https://wadduwagelab.github.io/">Dr. Dushan Wadduwage</a> and more broadly on signal processing, with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qe5byo4AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Chamira Edussooriya</a>. I have a keen interest in sparse signal analysis, and on the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning models. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	I completed my undergraduate engineering degree with First Class honors with the gold medal for my cohort at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering (ENTC), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My final year thesis project was on "Optical microscopy optimisation through compressive sensing and reconstruction" under the supervision of <a href="https://centerforadvancedimaging.harvard.edu/people/dushan-wadduwage-phd/">Dr. Dushan Wadduwage</a> and <a href= "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qe5byo4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Chamira Edussooriya</a>. This research project was a part of a collaboration with the <a href="https://wadduwagelab.github.io/">Wadduwage lab</a> at the Centre for advanced imaging at harvard university. I have worked in physics-based human motion prediction in the University of Sydney, Australia during my internship with <a href= "https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=y17ckyIAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Anusha Withana</a>.
